## **What is Cryptocurrency Mining?**
Cryptocurrency mining is the process of validating transactions and adding them to a blockchain ledger. Miners use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems, and in return, they earn cryptocurrency as a reward. Mining is essential for decentralized networks, ensuring security and transaction verification without the need for a central authority.

### **How Does a Miner Work?**
A miner is software that connects to a mining pool or blockchain network, using your computer's CPU or GPU to perform calculations. These calculations help process transactions, and as a reward, the miner receives cryptocurrency. 

Some popular cryptocurrencies that can be mined include:
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH) *(before moving to Proof of Stake)*
- Monero (XMR)
- Litecoin (LTC)

This miner primarily supports Monero (XMR) and other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.

## **Antivirus Detection & Security Notice**
Many antivirus programs may detect `XMRIG.EXE` and other mining software as a virus or malware. This is a **false positive**. The reason for this detection is that some malicious actors secretly install miners on victims' computers to mine cryptocurrency without their consent (a practice known as "cryptojacking"). As a result, antivirus companies often flag **all** mining software as a potential threat, even when it's being used legitimately.

### **Why Do Miners Get Flagged as Viruses?**
1. **Windows Defender and Antivirus Programs Protect Users from Unauthorized Mining**
   - Many miners are misused for hidden mining operations, leading antivirus software to block all mining programs by default.

2. **Mining Software Uses High CPU/GPU Resources**
   - Since mining requires significant computing power, some antivirus programs see this as abnormal activity.

3. **Mining Software Can Be Misused**
   - While legitimate miners like `XMRIG` are safe, hackers can modify them to run silently on compromised systems, leading security programs to classify them as threats.

4. **False Positives in Security Databases**
   - Mining software is often included in malware blacklists, even when downloaded from official sources.

### **How to Safely Use This Miner**
To install and run the miner without interference from your antivirus:
1. **Temporarily disable your antivirus or Windows Defender.**
2. **Download and extract the miner files.**
3. **Run the miner and allow the required files if prompted.**
4. **If necessary, add an exception for `XMRIG.EXE` to prevent future detections.**

If the file is deleted or blocked, the miner will not work properly.
